# Module-5--Lab-


Hello World,

Alex here. In this assignment, I was able to show different programs to 
be able to solve the problems. Each of the problems that I solved can be changed
to different number and it can still be able to run. For two of the problems, I was able to 
create  a flow chart for them to be able to show how it works and how it 
is able to run. These programs are important to be able to make the problems run the way they are supposed to run.

From Alex
